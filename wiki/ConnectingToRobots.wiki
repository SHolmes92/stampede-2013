#summary How to connect to each robot's wireless network.
Each robot is running an identical wireless network.  Each network has a distinct name (SSID). The names for the fall workshop are:
  * INrds
  * Outsourced
*You only need to connect to the robot to deploy code to the robot.*
To connect to a robot simply select the wireless network from your list and click "connect". Do NOT make your computer auto-connect to the Robot.
