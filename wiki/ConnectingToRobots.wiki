#summary How to connect to each robot's wireless network.
Each robot is running an identical wireless network.  Each network has a distinct name (SSID). The names (case sensitive!) for the fall workshop robots are:
  * INrds
  * Outsourced
*You only need to connect to the robot to deploy code to the robot.*
To connect to a robot simply select the wireless network from your list and click "connect". Do NOT make your computer auto-connect to the Robot.

Once you connect, your laptop will be assigned an IP address on the network and you will *NOT" be able to connect to the Internet (or access your school email). If you want to access te Internet, you need to disconnect from the robot (connect back to the regular school network).
